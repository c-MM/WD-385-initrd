## Initrd for WD MyCloudMirror gen2 und Ex2 Ultra
This custom initrd is for booting debian, ubuntu or other Linux Distibution
on WD MCMg2 or Ex2U

## Support
+ USB or SATA drive 
+ ext2,3,4, btrfs
+ raid 0,1 and LVM
+ LUKS-encrypted drive
+ ssh-rescue shell

## Usage 
Put OS on a partition labeled "rootfs" and OS should boot.
With encryption passphrase or keyfile could be used. If keyfile unlock is used keyfile 
"key.luks" has to be stored either on partion labeld "key" (usb or hdd) or in mnt/config/initrd 
(nand: /dev/mtd5/initrd). If passphrase is used, a ssh-shell on port 2222 and user: root is 
open and partiton can be unlocked with "cryptsetup -T 5 luksOpen $device cryptroot".

If rootfs is not found or something else went wrong a ssh-shell is open on port 2222 with user root.
Either you can enter shell with pressing reset-button while starting.
